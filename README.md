# athletic_sales_analysis
Jason Clibanoff | Module 5 Challenge

In this activity I read two data frames from csv files, and concatenate them together into one new data frame. 

From there I use the groupby and pivot table techniques to determine which regions and retailers sold the most products and made the most sales.

I then filter the data to show only womens athletic foorwear sales, and find the information on units sold again.

Lastly I use resampling to find the total sales for each day and each week.
